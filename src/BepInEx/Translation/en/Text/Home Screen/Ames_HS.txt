あんたもあたしも色々あったけど\n過去よりも今、今よりも未来を\nあたしたちでより良くしましょ♪=You and I have been through a lot, but let's make the present better than the past and the future better than the present together♪.
あたしが願う、行きたいところに\nあんたを連れてってあげられる…\n一緒に来てくれるわよね？=I can take you wherever you want to go... will you come with me?
ほら、あたしを連れていきなさい\nまたあんたのそばにいてあげるわ\n今度こそ、最後の最後までね=Come on, take me with you I'll stay by your side again This time, until the very end.
飛べるようにもなったし\nあんたに会いに来てやったわ\nうれしい？　もっと喜んでいいわよ=I learned to fly and I'm here to see you. Are you happy? You can be more happy.
失くしたはずの羽…\n大事にするわ。これであんたの\nピンチに駆けつけてあげるから=I thought I had lost these wings...I will treasure them. With these, I will come running to your aid in your time of need.

あんたが今見てるのは\n夢じゃなくて、本物のあたしよ\nじっくり拝んじゃいなさい♪=What you're looking at right now isn't a dream, it's the real me. Take a good look and worship me to your heart's content♪
暇だしあんた相手しなさいよ\n何をしたいか？　そうね…\nあんたが相手ならなんでもいいわ=I'm bored, so spend some time with me. What do I want to do, you ask? Let's see... Anything is fine as long as I'm with you.
背中のこれが羽かどうかって？\nいつの間にかこうだったのよ\nあたしもあんたとおんなじね=Is this thing on my back a wing? I don't know when it became like this. I guess I'm just like you.
あーあー…ちょっと待ちなさい\n髪が変になってる…これでよし\n相変わらずおっちょこちょいね=Oh dear... Wait a moment, your hair is a mess... There, that should do it.\nYou're still as clumsy as ever.
一人でどっか行かないのかって？\nあたしはね、あんたを放って何か\nしようって気にならないのよ=Do you want to go somewhere alone, you ask? As for me, I don't really have the urge to do anything while leaving you alone.
