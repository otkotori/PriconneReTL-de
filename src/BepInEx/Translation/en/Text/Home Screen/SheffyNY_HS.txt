おせち料理…食べすぎちゃった…\n…でも。食べないで後悔するより\n食べて後悔する日があっても\nいいわよね…♪=Osechi ryori...I ate too much ...... but it's ok to have a day when you regret eating it rather than not eating it. Even if there are days when I regret eating too much, it's okay...♪

待たせてごめんなさい\n着付けに時間がかかっちゃって…\n…え？　似合ってる？\nあ、ありがとう…=I'm sorry for making you wait. It took me some time to put on my kimono...Eh? Do I look good? T-thank you...

ど、どうかしら…？\nコッコロさんと一緒に選んだの…\n着付けも慣れてないし…\nその…変なところはない…？=I don't know...I chose this dress with Kokkoro-san...I'm not used to dressing like this...so...is there anything weird about it...?
『記念に写真を撮ろう』って…\nイ、イヤじゃないけど\n私一人だけじゃなくて…\nあなたとも一緒に撮りたいわ=When you say 'let's take a picture to remember this', I don't mind, but I don't just want to take a picture alone...I want to take a picture with you too.
