An Invitation to Vacation
That day, the Twinkle Wish got Yuuki's help to take on a request.
Knight-kun! Thanks for the help today!
Things went really smoothly thanks to you!
"Really smooth"...?
Hiyori? Sorry if I just imagined it, but I thought we were in a lot of trouble there.
W-Were we...?
Yui. Remind Hiyori what happened.
Umm, when you walked ahead of us, you fell into an ivy trap and...
{\b1}You were almost eaten by a monster.{\b0}
I'm sorry!!!
I didn't forget, so let me off the hook, Rei-san!
It was actually {\i1}really really{\i0} rough!
Goodness...
But, getting out of the situation went quite smoothly.
Thanks to Knight-kun strengthening Hiyori-chan, me and Rei-chan were able to focus on the surrounding area.
Yeah, yeah! And from there, it was just, {\i1}boom{\i0} and we turn the tables hard!
At our best, we'd never lose against anything.
Yup, yup!
All's well that ends well... Can we leave it at that?
Hiyori. If he weren't around, we'd have been in trouble.
Don't think things'll always turn out that well, okay?
Oh, right...
Yeah. I'll be careful!
Since Knight-kun was with us today, it was so much fun that I wasn't thinking...
Ehehe.
So you were just really excited.
Then what can you do? Let's just leave things at that.
Really? What a relief!
Huh? Then Rei-san, that means you...
I didn't notice the trap either...
so I guess we were all really excited.
{\b1}I was actually having a lot of fun too, so...{\b0}
You too? Then we were {\i1}all{\i0} having a good time...!
Ehehe! It really {\i1}was{\i0} fun!
Yeah. I'm glad we were able to adventure like this again.
Next time, let's settle for a request that probably {\i1}won't{\i0} have any traps.
Rei-san!? So you {\i1}are{\i0} still mad about it!
Rei-chan, don't tease her so much.
Yeah, I'll stop there.
Let's go report back at the guild association and have some lunch.
Geez! You're such a bully!
Knight-kun, you say something to Rei-san too!
The four of them finish reporting back to the guild association, and once they finish eating in the shopping district...
Thanks for the food!
Please come again!
Oh yes, please take this ticket.
Give it to the man over there for a chance at the lottery.
Interested in trying? Anyone with a ticket can give it a spin!
Just come right over and spin this device!
Thanks, we'll give it a shot.
What's it for?
Maybe we'll get a plate for first place?
We'd just broken one, so that'd be perfect. I hope we get that.
Excuse me! We got a ticket from that store just now!
What's this lottery for?
Currently, this is for an invitation to the "Beach Game Tournament" being held at the southern island!
Beach Game Tournament?
Yes!
We're holding a variety of games in teams of 4 along the seashore!
Winners will be allowed to take part in the tournament.
We hold this tournament every summer,
and the participants are brought to the southern island where they can stay at our arranged resort.
It doesn't matter how you place in the tournament, you're free to vacation there until it's time to leave!
There's both games {\i1}and{\i0} a vacation!?
Umm, what kind of games are there?
They always change the games every year, so I wouldn't know about this year's games, but...
In the past, they've had home run derbies with beach baseball, beach soccer...
They've also held beach quizzes challenges, for battles of intellect on the hot sand.
All those games sound worth a challenge.
What do you say? Would you like to give it a spin?
Yup, yup! I'll do it!
It'd be fun to enjoy some games with everyone... And a trip...
A breather on occasion doesn't sound so bad either.
A trip to the southern island together...
Sounds nice...!
Then, please decide which one of you'll give it a spin.
Be careful though, you only get one chance.
Only one...?
Should I really be the one to do this?
I'm really not confident about these things...
Good luck, Hiyori-chan!
It's based on luck. No one'll blame you for missing it.
{\b1}It's you Hiyori, you'll be fine.{\b0}
Everyone...
Okay! Leave it to me!
Here I go!
Congratulations!! You've just earned an invitation!
Really?
Yay! I got it, Rei-san! Yui-san! Knight-kun!
That's amazing, Hiyori-chan! Really, really amazing!
Goodness, you really are something...
You really are the best at these things, Hiyori.
{\b1}Congrats!!{\b0}
What're you saying? You're coming with us, Knight-kun!
{\b1}Hooray!!{\b0}
Now then, let's have you go through the entry process.
First, fill out this form with your team name and your name.
The team name... Uhh...
Team Twinkle... Let's go with this!
You'll be Team Twinkle then.
Next, please write down something that all of you love.
What do you mean by... something we love?
For this tournament, we want the participants to compete from the bottom of their hearts,
so we'll be preparing prizes related to what people write down.
Oh okay! Then we just have to write something we all like!
Umm, then...
Yeah, right. The question came so suddenly.
Hmm, what exactly do we all like...?
It's not a like, but a {\i1}love{\i0} though, so isn't that a bit different?
Something you love...
{\b1}What's the matter?{\b0}
I-It's nothing!
Y-Yeah. Don't worry about it.
If you two've come up with something, put it down!
I can't think of anything!
U-Umm...
There's other groups that submitted blank, so no worries.
Just tell the manager before you take the boat to the island.
That's all I have to explain to you, but do you have any questions?
I'm all good!
What about you two?
I have none in particular.
Though we'll have to think of an answer before we board the ship.
Yeah...
Besides that, I'm fine too.
Thank you very much.
Then, here's the pamphlet and entry ticket. Don't forget to bring it on the day of.
Yes, thank you very much.
I'll be wishing you the best of luck from the bottom of my heart.
The southern island...
Sounds exciting!
Should we bring anything?
Maybe it'll say on the pamphlet we got...?
It looks like they'll provide food and everything.
So we shouldn't need to...
Ah!
Yui? What's the matter?
Umm. I'd like to ask you two something...
What, what? What do you need?
Umm...
{\i1}whispering{\i0}
Oh! You're right!
Then I wanna go buy one too!
Me too. The one I have is fairly old by now.
And... I'd like for you two to help me choose one...
{\b1}What're you talking about?{\b0}
Knight-kun!? Thing is-
Sorry! We just remembered some important business!
Y-Yeah! Knight-kun, thanks for coming today!
S-See you later!
Don't push me, Rei-san, Yui-chaaan!
Kishi-kuuun! Don't forget to bring your swimsuit!
With that, Yuuki parts ways with Hiyori and the others, who go shopping while unable to contain their excitement.
